TESTING LOGS
-----------------
Jude Rorie
-----------------

(10/05/25) - Created "hello world!" Prints in the window just fine.
			 TODO: Start implementing article text scrapers.

(10/28/25) - Testing BBC parser. Text is pulled fine but I am finding that sometimes it will use the fallback scraper as
			 opposed to the main parser. I should update the logic for that.
			 TODO: Rely less on fallback parser and use consistent logic for specialized parser.

(11/02/25) - New BBC article functionality. Looks to work fine on most articles I test it on, and the metadata is printing too.
			 TODO: Implement rest of the parsers.
			 
(11/18/25) - Implement Guardian parser. Looks to work fine there too. Shane is good at his job.
			 TODO: Implement NBC parser. Start creating backend.
			 
(11/20/25) - Creating the backend. I'm new to Render so there's a lot here that may need testing. Bias detection is added but for whatever reason
			 I'm not getting any of the fetch calls from OpenAI even though I configured a key and everything. I'll test more tomorrow. NBC parser is
			 also implemented and working as intended.
			 TODO: Finalize setup of backend. Maybe think about proper UI.
			
(11/21/25) - This backend stuff is confusing. I'm using POST method but I'm seeing GET in the logs. What is causing this? I don't know. But I only
			 see one GET method and it is for the exposing of FastAPI, but the URL it is grabbing is not /api/. I'll further specialize the prompt
			 in the meantime but I don't think it'll go anywhere. Apart from that, I gave the extension a name (UnBiased.) and updated its UI. I felt
			 a nice lowkey minimalistic look would suit it well. I like it a lot.
			 TODO: Fix this server error

(11/23/25) - Added Shane's CBS parser PR. Works as intended. Still stuck on this Render server stuff. Tried to implement CORS middleware but apparently that
			 won't solve anything regarding this hidden GET. I'm still not sure where it comes from.
			 TODO: Still fix this server error and implement rest of parsers. I'm going insane
			 
(11/25/25) - I figured out the issue, Render does health checks every 5 seconds and uses its own GET method. I needed to configure a path for it, so I did, and
			 now that works fine. However, I'm consistently getting "No Obvious Bias" results even on pages with clear bias now. After checking the console, I
			 found that the parsers just aren't being used at all now. How? I'm not sure, but that should be an easy fix I suppose since it is a frontend thing.
			 Also I wanted to configure some things about the OpenAI model, particularly its token output maximums and its prompt, I'm noticing its picking up bias
			 statements from quotes, which alone isn't bias. I will further engineer this to instead take these quotes as context for other potential bias depending
			 on how the author intends to use them.
			 TODO: Fine tune model and implement rest of parsers.
			 
(12/01/25) - Implemented Shane's highlighter logic, also works as intended. I fixed the parser logic as well so we are using the specialized parsers instead of the scrapers.
			 Finally, this is going somewhere. The prompt is mostly doing its job, but there are still some inconsistencies. I will have to further engineer the prompt.
			 
(12/09/25) - Final prompt changes. These ones I think will be final. Or at least ones that need the least amount of changing. It works fine, and Shane's iframe logic makes the
			 window spew less errors, so less stuff for me to worry about. Khaled's CNN parser also works as intended. Other group members are working on the presentation and finalizing
       some last-minute bug fixes, which there hopefully aren't many since I haven't found much.

(12/10/25) - Final testing processes. Creating article fetching was at first inconsistent since I was searching using the entire article's
			 title. I switched to using a truncated article title, and it appears to work fine, at least more consistently. The article rendering
			 was also pretty simple, although I moved the url to the bottom box for appearance purposes. Thank god everything appears to be done.
